Solvuria is a Tassomai automation utility which excels in ease of use, and accuracy.
The tool automatically inputs answers without manual intervention, excluding the initial setup which offers several customisation options,
which can be changed within the [presets.json](#Presets) file.
The bot can vary its time between questions, and quizzes, aswell as allowing for a custom accuracy which decreases 
the chance of the bot being detected.
